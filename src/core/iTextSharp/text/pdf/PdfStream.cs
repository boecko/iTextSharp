     * <CODE>PdfStream</CODE> is the Pdf stream object.
     * <P>
     * A stream, like a string, is a sequence of characters. However, an application can
     * read a small portion of a stream at a time, while a string must be read in its entirety.
     * For this reason, objects with potentially large amounts of data, such as images and
     * page descriptions, are represented as streams.<BR>
     * A stream consists of a dictionary that describes a sequence of characters, followed by
     * the keyword <B>stream</B>, followed by zero or more lines of characters, followed by
     * the keyword <B>endstream</B>.<BR>
     * All streams must be <CODE>PdfIndirectObject</CODE>s. The stream dictionary must be a direct
     * object. The keyword <B>stream</B> that follows the stream dictionary should be followed by
     * a carriage return and linefeed or just a linefeed.<BR>
     * Remark: In this version only the FLATEDECODE-filter is supported.<BR>
     * This object is described in the 'Portable Document Format Reference Manual version 1.3'
     * section 4.8 (page 41-53).<BR>
