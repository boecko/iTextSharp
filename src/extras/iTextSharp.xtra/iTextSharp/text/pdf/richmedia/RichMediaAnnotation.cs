    /**
     * Object that is able to create Rich Media Annotations as described
     * in the document "Acrobat Supplement to the ISO 32000", referenced
     * in the code as "ExtensionLevel 3". This annotation is described in
     * section 9.6 entitled "Rich Media" of this document.
     * Extension level 3 introduces rich media PDF constructs that support
     * playing a SWF file and provide enhanced rich media. With rich media
     * annotation, Flash applications, video, audio, and other multimedia
     * can be attached to a PDF with expanded functionality. It improves upon
     * the existing 3D annotation structure to support multiple multimedia
     * file assets, including Flash video and compatible variations on the
     * H.264 format. The new constructs allow a two-way scripting bridge between
     * Flash and a conforming application. There is support for generalized
     * linking of a Flash application state to a comment or view, which enables
     * video commenting. Finally, actions can be linked to video chapter points.
     * @since   5.0.0
